                    <p>
                        I am currently studying a fullstack software development course and not working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        I believe that becoming a software developer is for me for the following reasons. I 
                        am very curious so follow up on new information and often double check using third 
                        party sources. I am quite analytical and great with numbers. I read a lot of books to 
                        my daughter which allows my imagination to evolve, helping me realise new ideas. 
                        My favourite part of any job I have held in the past is working with others. Since I 
                        come from factorys and yards, I developed dependable communication skills with my 
                        colleagues as well as my superiors.
                        <!-- I believe my best quality is I'm very curious. I love reading about histroy,
                        scientific discovery's, gardening and animal biology. Because of this, I am always
                        asking questions. Whilst others might shy away from asking potential nonsense,
                        I have no shame in questioning an approach or specific action. -->
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Being able to create applications and websites to look however I see fit is what 
                        first pulled me into reserching software development. Upon learning what this position 
                        entails and the numerous opportunities available, I had no other option to pursue this path.
                        Whilst my skills right now are not at best, I would happily take any option to learn more. 
                        Especially if it means working alongside others because i feel that teamwork really makes 
                        the dreamwork. I know this career will make me happy!
                        <!-- I also have plenty of discussions with my family about these topic's so I have very reliable
                        communication
                        skills. Pair this with my analytical side, and you have someone who would excel in
                        a team-based environment. I am extremely interested in coding because having the ability
                        to create applications and websites that will allow my imagination run wild is
                        appealing to me. -->

                            All of my previous job's have been mainly physical such as working on large machinery in
                            a factory, with car parts in a scrap yard and packaging with little computer work but
                            having experience in many fast-paced environments has taught me patience and teamwork.
