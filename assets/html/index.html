                    <p>
                        I am currently studying a fullstack software development course and not working.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        I believe my best quality is I'm very curious. I love reading about histroy,
                        scientific discovery's, gardening and animal biology. Because of this, I am always
                        asking questions. Whilst others might shy away from asking potential nonsense,
                        I have no shame in questioning an approach or specific action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br>
                        I also have plenty of discussions with my family about these topic's so I have very reliable
                        communication
                        skills. Pair this with my analytical side, and you have someone who would excel in
                        a team-based environment. I am extremely interested in coding because having the ability
                        to create applications and websites that will allow my imagination run wild is
                        appealing to me.

                            All of my previous job's have been mainly physical such as working on large machinery in
                            a factory, with car parts in a scrap yard and packaging with little computer work but
                            having experience in many fast-paced environments has taught me patience and teamwork.
